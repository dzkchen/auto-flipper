# Edited BAF

My attempt to edit Luiz-Baf and port it into the new version.

## Is this bannable

Yes, it is against the TOS of Hypixel, so don't use it if you don't want to risk that. Futhermore, this is my edit and I'm barely capable of coding.

## Note

-   Keep money in your purse and have booster cookie active gang

## Getting Started

### BAF with Node Guide

The OS that I use on my VPS is Linux Ubuntu 22.04 x86 64 Min Gen2 V1

#### Basic Cmds for VPS:

ls - show what files are in the directory you are, useful for if you are lost
cd - allows you to go into a directory (eg. cd luiz-baf)
cd -  - allows you to get back one directory
npm run start - you will use this whenever you want to start BAF after you have built it

### Tutorial

1. sudo apt install nodejs (say yes to any prompts)
2. sudo apt install npm (say yes to any prompts)
3. sudo apt install curl
4. curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.38.0/install.sh | bash
5. source ~/.bashrc
6. nvm install v20.10.0
7. git clone https://github.com/dzkchen/shit-flipper
8. Navigate to Shit Flipper Folder (cd shit-flipper)
9. npm i 
10. npm run start

Edit any config
